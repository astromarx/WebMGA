# WebMGA
### WebGL Molecular Graphics Application

[WebMGA](https://astromarx.github.io/WebMGA) is an evolution of [QMGA](http://qmga.sourceforce.net). It is based on WebGL and written in JavaScript with [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [React Suite](https://rsuitejs.com/), while QMGA is based on OpenGL and Qt 3 and written in C++. The main advantage of WebMGA is that it can be run straight away in a web browser, while QMGA needs to be compiled and installed, which may reveal cumbersome and currently is supported only for Linux.

WebMGA was developed by Eduardo Battistini Parra in 2020-21 for his final project within the BSc Computer Science at University College London supervised by Guido Germano, Tobias Ritschel and Michael P. Allen.

WebMGA includes a small library of liquid crystal configurations generated by Michael P. Allen. Please find an educational description of these systems in the 'About' section of WebMGA.
